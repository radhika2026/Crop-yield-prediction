Prediction of crop yield
Rainfall and Temperature:
The data was sequential in nature thus time series analysis algorithms were
used:
1. LSTM : LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and
making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of
unknown duration between important events in a time series.
2. Simple RNN : A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial
neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph
along a sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behaviour for
a time sequence.
3. Linear Regression : Forecasting by minimizing the errors in prediction in
past.

● Final Dataset :
Regression Analysis and Classification Analysis were both applied on this data
set.
1. KNN Regressor and classification
2. Artificial Neural Net
3. Linear Regression
4. SGD Regressor and classification
5. Random Forest Regressor and classification
